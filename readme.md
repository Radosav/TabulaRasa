#Tabula Rasa

Tabula Rasa is a student project created to allow easier access to lectures and easier lecture creation for teachers and students alike. This software aims to aid teachers and student that are unable to hold/attend regular lectures but rather rely on the internet for learning.

## Laravel PHP Framework
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
